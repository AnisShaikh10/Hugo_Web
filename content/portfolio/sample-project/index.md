It is a platform that allows people to register a complaint regarding the issue faced by them, in their daily life. The user can register complaints on three major issues: Potholes/BadRoad, Water, and Electricity in their locality. With the help of this platform, the data given by users can be used to notify the respective department regarding problems faced by people in a particular area, so that action can be taken to solve that problem as soon as possible.

If the user has filed a complaint, the location of a particular area will be marked on the map to show where the problem occurs, initially, the color of the marking will be a lighter color and as the days go by the color will turn darker shade to show the severity of the problem.
